Getting Started
===============

The device comes preloaded with the kernel and firmware for operation. Before using 
the first time use, please charge the Modem for at least 15 minutes with a micro-USB 
cable. A full battery will last approximately 8-10 hours during operation.

To turn on, press the button on the side of the device once until the LED lights 
stay on. If there are no lights emitting from the device, ensure that the device 
is charged.

Once the device is on, the device will automatically proceed with the auto 
start script, which initiates the connection and data communication with a VI and 
Android Device.

In order to connect with the Android device, go to the Google Play Store to download 
and install “OpenXC Enabler” on the Android device. Be sure Bluetooth is enabled 
before trying to connect to the Modem. Once the Modem is running the main function, 
connect to the OpenXC-Modem from the Android device using Bluetooth. The 
password/pin code is “1234”.
