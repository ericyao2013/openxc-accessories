Getting Started
===============

The OpenXC-Modem and OpenXC-V2X/RSU devices come preloaded with the kernel and firmware for operation. Before using 
for the first time, please charge the devices for at least 15 minutes with a micro-USB 
cable, or 12V wall wort. A full battery will last approximately 8-10 hours during operation.

To turn on, press the button on the side of the device once until the LED lights 
stay on. If there are no lights emitting from the device, ensure that the device 
is charged.  Please note, this is a latching button that needs to be pushed in far enough to latch (a little past where the LEDs turn on).

Once the device is on, the device will automatically proceed with the auto 
start script, which initiates the connection and data communication with a VI and 
Android Device.

The following sections describe the next steps.
