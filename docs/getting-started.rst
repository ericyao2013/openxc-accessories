Getting Started
===============

The device comes preloaded with the kernel and firmware for operation. Before using 
the first time use, please charge the Modem for at least 15 minutes with a micro-USB 
cable. A full battery will last approximately 8-10 hours during operation.

To turn on, press the button on the side of the device once until the LED lights 
stay on. If there are no lights emitting from the device, ensure that the device 
is charged.

Once the device is on, the device will automatically proceed with the auto 
start script, which initiates the connection and data communication with a VI and 
Android Device.

The following sections describe the next steps.
