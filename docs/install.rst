Android
--------
.. TODO use the Enabler Modem accessory branch until play store is merged.

In order to connect with the Android device, install the *accessories* branch of 
the Enabler in the openxc-android project. That branch is currently unavailable, but will be uploaded soon. 
The \.apk is available `here <https://github.com/openxc/openxc-accessories/tree/master/tools/openxc-enabler-v6.0.6-modem.354.apk>`_.

..
 In order to connect with the Android device, go to the Google Play Store to download 
 and install “OpenXC Enabler” on the Android device. 

Be sure Bluetooth is enabled 
before trying to connect to the Modem. Once the Modem is running the main function, 
connect to the OpenXC-Modem from the Android device using Bluetooth. The 
password/pin code is “1234”.

Windows
-------

The main method of configuring and setting up the modem will be through USB from the 
Modem to a Windows PC. A program called Teraterm will be used to interface with the 
operating system on the device. To allow ease of use, a program called “OpenXC Modem Connect” 
will be used to automatically configure the connection settings. 

.. note:: 
 Using OpenXC Modem Connect is suggested for easier and faster access to the Modem, 
 although you may choose to manually configure TeraTerm to configure the modem. 

Download OpenXC Modem Connect `here <https://github.com/openxc/openxc-accessories/blob/master/tools/ModemConnect/ModemConnect-v1.0.0.143.msi>`_. Detailed instructions are available `here <https://github.com/openxc/openxc-accessories/blob/master/tools/ModemConnect/Documents/OpenXC%20Modem%20Connect%20App%20Installation%20Procedure.docx>`_.
